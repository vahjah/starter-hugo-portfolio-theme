👋 Hi, there! I am an aspiring blockchain developer with background in law, finance and programming. I am passionate about reducing corruption in the world through decentralization. My career goal is to help organizations transition to the on-chain world by handling everything from writing the smart-contracts for a DAO to setting up the legal infrastructure for the organization.
